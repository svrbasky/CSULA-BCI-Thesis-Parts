\section{Abstract}
Self-mobility for Quadriplegics is a challenging problem as most have little functional muscle for an external human-machine interface (HMI), while invasive controls are expensive and dangerous. A viable option is the use of surface electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that can be achieved using affordable devices like the Emotiv EPOC.
This thesis aims to compare two BCI algorithms, one using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and the other using  artificial neural networks (ANN) in an attempt to develop an effective BCI algorithm that detects motor intent in the user in order to control a wheelchair.
The Physionet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset is used to test the chosen algorithms. It is observed that accuracies of SVM classifiers and ANN classifiers are 85\% and 90\% respectively.

 % These numbers are randomly added. 
 % Change to exact numbers upon obtaining results from Matlab. 
 % Also add the False Positive, Missed Detection rates, 
 % ROC and statistical power comparisons, when computed as relevant.
